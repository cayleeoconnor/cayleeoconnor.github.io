## About Me

I am an Economist at The Burning Glass Institute. I received my PhD in Economics from Stanford University, where I studied public, labor, and development economics. I am particularly passionate about understanding how to improve education quality and increase access to high-quality education amongst underserved communities in both the U.S. and low- and middle-income countries.
