abstract: After the end of court-mandated desegregation plans, many school districts in the U.S. have become re-segregated on race and economic status. In 2018, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools piloted a new voluntary integration plan in an attempt to curtail high rates of re-segregation within the district. This paper studies whether the new integration plan 1) was successful at reducing economic segregation within neighborhood schools, and/or 2) had an effect on students' educational outcomes.
