abstract: After the end of court-mandated desegregation plans, many school districts in the U.S. have become re-segregated on race and economic status. In 2018, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools piloted a new voluntary integration plan in an attempt to curtail high rates of re-segregation within the district. This paper studies whether the new integration plan 1) was successful at reducing economic segregation within neighborhood schools, and/or 2) had an effect on students' educational outcomes.

## Interactive Map

The interactive map below displays public elementary schools in the continental United States that could be paired on socioeconomic status (SES) under the following criteria: 1) each pair consists of two elementary schools within the same district that are no more than two miles apart, where one school has a majority of low-SES students (determined by the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced lunch) and the other has a majority of high-SES students; and 2) the difference in the proportion of low-SES students between the two schools in each pair must be at least 55 percentage points. If there are multiple potential pairs in an area, the pairs are selected to maximize the total number of pairs. I used nonfiscal data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) for the 2018-19 academic year to generate these pairs, as many districts did not report lunch program eligibility during the pandemic.
