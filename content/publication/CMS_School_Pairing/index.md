abstract: After the end of court-mandated desegregation plans, many school districts in the U.S. have become re-segregated on race and economic status. In 2018, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools piloted a new voluntary integration plan in an attempt to curtail high rates of re-segregation within the district. This paper studies whether the new integration plan 1) was successful at reducing economic segregation within neighborhood schools, and/or 2) had an effect on students' educational outcomes.

## Interactive Map

The interactive map below shows public elementary schools in the continental United States that could be paired on socioeconomic status (SES) under the following criteria: 1) each pair contains two elementary schools in the same district that are within two miles of each other, for which one has a majority of low-SES students (as determined by the proportion of its students eligible for free or reduced lunch) and the other has a majority of high-SES students; and 2) the gap between the proportion of low-SES students at schools in a pair must be at least 55 percentage points. If there are multiple potential pairs in an area, individual pairs are chosen in a way that maximizes the total number of pairs. I used Common Core of Data (CCD) nonfiscal data from the 2018-19 academic year to generate pairs. 2018-19 data are used as many districts did not report lunch program eligibility during the pandemic.
