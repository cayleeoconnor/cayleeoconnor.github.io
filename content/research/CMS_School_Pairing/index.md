abstract: Since the end of court-mandated desegregation, many U.S. school districts have re-segregated along racial and economic lines. This paper examines the impacts of a 2018 school pairing policy in Charlotte, North Carolina which sought to increase socioeconomic integration within elementary schools by combining student populations from diverse schools. The results indicate that while the policy significantly reduced economic segregation, it also triggered a sharp decline in enrollment, suggesting that many families opted out of paired schools. In terms of educational outcomes, third-through-fifth grade students from predominantly low-SES neighborhoods experienced declines in standardized test performance and increased short-term suspension rates, whereas those from predominantly high-SES neighborhoods showed modest gains in test scores and no change in suspension likelihood. These effects cannot be attributed to teacher turnover -- in fact, the policy increased teacher retention at affected schools. With respect to the local housing market, I find suggestive evidence that neighborhoods previously zoned to majority low-SES schools experienced an increase in house prices after the policy was implemented, while those previously zoned to high-SES schools saw a reduction in house prices.

## Interactive Map

The interactive map below displays public elementary schools in the continental United States that could be paired on socioeconomic status (SES) under the following criteria: 1) each pair consists of two elementary schools within the same district that are no more than two miles apart, where one school has a majority of low-SES students (determined by the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced lunch) and the other has a majority of high-SES students; and 2) the difference in the proportion of low-SES students between the two schools in each pair must be at least 40 percentage points. If there are multiple potential pairs in an area, the pairs are selected to maximize the total number of pairs. I used nonfiscal data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) for the 2018-19 academic year to generate these pairs, as many districts did not report lunch program eligibility during the pandemic.

Visually, the two schools in a pair have the same border color, but the majority low-SES school is filled white and the majority high-SES school is filled black. If you click on a school, you can see the school name, district name, pair ID, and proportion of low-SES students at the school in 2018-19.
