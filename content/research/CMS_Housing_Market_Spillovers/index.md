abstract: 'It is well-documented that the implementation of historical desegregation plans often led to “white flight,” whereby white parents affected by integration plans either moved their children to private schools or relocated to avoid integration. However, the extent to which white or “rich” flight continues in response to modern school integration efforts is unclear. This paper examines the persistence of this phenomenon by studying a recent elementary school integration policy implemented by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in 2018. Using data on house characteristics, house sales, and school attendance boundaries before and after the policy change, I compare properties on either side of the affected attendance boundaries to determine whether the policy influenced the likelihood of a house being sold or the sale price of houses. I find that the average sale price of homes on the treated side of the affected attendance boundary increased in response to the policy; however, these average effects mask heterogeneity in treatment effects. While the average price of homes in formerly majority low-SES attendance zones increased, the price of homes in formerly majority high-SES attendance zones decreased.'
